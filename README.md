# OOP Lab Tasks (C# .NET 7.0 and .NET Framework 4.7.2)

This repository contains all my source code from oop's labtasks from 1 to 13 using C#.

**All the questions are mentioned in the READEME.md file of each labtask folder.**
*also you can find the output of each question in the Assets folder of each labtask folder.*

## Lab Task 1 to 10
Lab Task 1 to 10 are console applications so i used VS Code to write and compile them.

### How to compile and run console applications in VS Code
1. Open the folder containing the source code in VS Code.
2. Open the terminal in VS Code.
3. Type `dotnet run` in the terminal and press enter to compile and run the application.

**Note that you must have .NET 7.0 installed in your system including C# extension from VS Code market place to compile and run the application.**

## Lab Task 11 to 13
Lab Task 11 to 13 are windows forms applications so i used Visual Studio 2022 to write and compile them.

### How to compile and run windows forms applications in Visual Studio 2022
1. Open the folder containing the source code in Visual Studio 2022.
2. Press `Ctrl + Shift + B` to compile the application.
3. Press `Ctrl + F5` to run the application.

I prefer using VS Code over Visual Studio 2022 because it is lightweight and fast but i had to use Visual Studio 2022 for windows forms applications because VS Code doesn't support windows forms applications by default (drag and drop feature is not available in VS Code).
